The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive ATS Resume Checker application named Bruwrite, iteratively refining it based on extensive user feedback. Initially, a simple frontend with mock data was created, followed by an attempt at backend implementation. The development trajectory involved multiple rounds of bug fixing for both frontend (missing imports, relative paths) and backend (import errors, PDF parsing issues, generic analysis). The user consistently reported errors and a lack of proper analysis, leading to a significant shift from a basic, non-AI checker to a highly detailed and weighted analysis system. The final product incorporates precise user-defined analysis parameters, a sophisticated scoring system, and a structured output report, as requested in the latter stages of the conversation. The latest interaction involved organizing the project file structure.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a pixel-perfect clone of an online ATS resume checker, prioritizing functionality over a specific design or website. The application needed to be a full-stack solution. Early in the development, the user clarified a need for a simple, working ATS resume checker feature without complex AI, pricing, or sign-up, intended for integration into an existing website.

However, after a basic implementation was deemed insufficient, the requirements evolved significantly and became highly detailed:
1.  **Input Handling**: Support .docx and text-based .pdf, allow pasting job descriptions, and ensure clean text extraction.
2.  **Resume Parsing & Analysis**:
    *   **Keywords & Relevance**: Compare JD keywords, identify missing critical keywords, show keyword density.
    *   **Formatting & Structure**: Flag tables, columns, images; verify ATS-friendly fonts; ensure standard section headers.
    *   **Work Experience**: Check reverse-chronological order, industry-standard job titles, action verbs, quantifiable achievements.
    *   **Skills Section**: Extract hard/soft skills, check alignment with JD, ensure balance.
    *   **Education & Certifications**: Extract degrees/dates, recognize certifications.
    *   **Contact & Identification**: Ensure contact info, flag bias-sensitive details.
    *   **Readability & Grammar**: Check grammar/spelling, provide readability score.
    *   **ATS Parsing Test**: Simulate ATS extraction to prevent information loss.
3.  **Scoring System**: Provide a Job Match Score (0-100%) with specific weights: Keywords & Skills (40%), Formatting & Structure (20%), Work Experience (20%), Education & Certifications (10%), Readability & Grammar (10%).
4.  **Output Report**: Generate a clear report with Strengths, Weaknesses, Suggestions. Allow PDF export, include visual graphs (e.g., pie charts for percentages), and provide 10-pointer final recommendations.
5.  **Branding**: The company name should be Bruwrite.
6.  **Accuracy**: The analysis must differentiate properly (not 52% for everything) and distinguish resumes from non-resume documents like bills.

<code_architecture>



-   : The main React application file. It defines the routing and integrates the core components like , , , , and .
    -   **Changes**: Initially contained a simple Hello World call. It was significantly refactored multiple times to incorporate the file upload, job description input, and display the analysis results. Imports for components like  were added. The state management for the entire application, including , , , , and , is handled here.
-   : The FastAPI application entry point. It sets up CORS middleware, defines core API routes (, ), and integrates the backend services.
    -   **Changes**: Evolved from a basic Hello World endpoint to a complex API that orchestrates resume parsing, ATS scoring, and comprehensive analysis. It imports and utilizes , , and  services. Error handling, document type detection, and input validation were added.
-   : This newly created file (Message 189) is central to the final, detailed ATS analysis. It encapsulates the complex logic for assessing resumes based on the user's detailed checklist (keywords, formatting, experience, skills, education, contact, readability, ATS parsing).
    -   **Changes**: Created from scratch to implement the highly detailed, weighted scoring and analysis algorithm.
-   : Handles the extraction of text from various resume formats (.pdf, .docx, .txt) and initial parsing for sections and keywords.
    -   **Changes**: Initially, a simpler  was used, but this  (Message 171) was introduced to provide robust text extraction and handling of complex document structures, leveraging PyMuPDF and python-docx.
-   : Responsible for calculating scores based on various resume attributes, applying the user-defined weights.
    -   **Changes**: Created (Message 171) to implement the weighted scoring system (40% Keywords, 20% Formatting, etc.)
-   : Manages the drag-and-drop file upload interface and the associated button for selecting files.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented to handle file selection, display selected file names, and trigger the upload process to the backend. Includes the Try Demo Analysis button.
-   : Provides the input fields for the optional job title and job description.
    -   **Changes**: Added to meet the explicit requirement for including job-specific context in the analysis.
-   : Renders the overall ATS score and the breakdown of individual category scores.
    -   **Changes**: Updated multiple times to display a more nuanced and category-specific scoring, including visual progress bars for each weighted component.
-   : Displays the detailed analysis report, including strengths, weaknesses, suggestions, keyword matches, and other metrics across various tabs.
    -   **Changes**: Significantly enhanced to present the comprehensive analysis report in a structured, multi-tab format, adhering to the user's detailed checklist for each resume section and overall recommendations.
-   : Documents the API contracts, mocked data, backend implementation plan, and frontend/backend integration strategy.
    -   **Changes**: Created to formalize the integration points.
-   : A markdown file summarizing the capabilities and testing results of the comprehensive ATS system.
    -   **Changes**: Created (Message 183) to provide a detailed overview of the final, working system.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully implemented a comprehensive, professional ATS Resume Checker named Bruwrite. This application now performs highly detailed resume analysis against user-provided job titles and descriptions.

The current state of the product includes:
-   **Frontend (React)**: A clean, modern UI featuring a header, optional job title and job description input fields, a drag-and-drop resume upload section (supporting PDF, DOCX, TXT), and a Try Demo Analysis button. The analysis results are displayed in a multi-tabbed panel () with sections for:
    -   Executive Summary (Overall ATS Score, Keyword Match, Skills Match, Formatting & Readability, Summary Statement)
    -   Detailed Section Analysis (Contact Info, Skills, Work Experience, Keywords & Industry Relevance), each with a checklist, Pass/Fail analysis, and specific recommendations.
    -   Advanced analysis features like keyword density and ATS parsing simulation.
    -   Visual elements like progress bars are used for scores.
-   **Backend (FastAPI)**: A robust backend responsible for:
    -   File handling and text extraction from various resume formats using .
    -   Sophisticated analysis logic encapsulated in , which implements all the detailed checklists and parameters requested by the user (e.g., action verbs, quantifiable achievements, font checks, bias detection, grammar/readability).
    -   A  that applies the user-defined weighted scoring system (40% Keywords, 20% Formatting, etc.).
    -   Accurate document type detection to reject non-resume files like bills.
-   **Database (MongoDB)**: Integrated for potential data storage, though the extent of its current use for persistent analysis results is not fully detailed in the most recent messages.
-   **Branding**: The application is branded as Bruwrite ATS Resume Checker.
-   **Bug Fixes**: The critical bool object is not iterable error and previous generic analysis issues have been resolved.
